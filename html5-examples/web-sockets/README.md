Some WebSocket Examples
=======================

Echo Test
---------

echo-client.html can be used with WebSocket.org's echo server.

echo-server.js is a Node.js server that does the same thing.

Real-time Stock Updates
-----------------------

stock-client.html is the client.

stock-server.js is the server and must be running.

I hope it's obvious that the data is fake and that this is only
demonstrating the mechanics of using the WebSocket API.
